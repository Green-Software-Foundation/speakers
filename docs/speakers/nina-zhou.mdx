  shortBiography="As Head of DEISSC China, I’m responsible for leading China’s DEISSC strategy and implementation across China. I’m always inspired by how Thoughtworks has been embedding social mission into the heart during the business growth over the years. The spirit of Tech@Core also allows me to rethink how to address the prevailing social and environmental challenges and opportunities with the technologies.
                  I feel honored and privileged to work extensively with local partners from the non-profit sector and academia for positive social change in the past 8 years.  This has also been a great opportunity for the China team to dive deeper on the issues of rural education, gender equity, sustainability, responsibility tech and beyond.
                  Prior to Thoughtworks, I had 6 years of experience in CSR/ESG, both inhouse and consulting. I also have a unique combination of experience in social innovation, cross-border collaborations and NGOs capability building.
                  I’m an avid traveler, snowboarder, and coffee lover."

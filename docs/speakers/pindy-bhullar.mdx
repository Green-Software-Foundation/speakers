  shortBiography="My varied work experience centres around programme and change management, delivering business solutions in technology, transformation and change projects. I am currently working as ESG CTO, determining the ESG technical architecture across the bank incorporating digital and data principles. The scope of ESG metrics is to differentiate between the firm as an operating company and as a financial service provider. I am also a founding member of the Sustainable Technology Guild, which is a group that is focusing on innovative ideas to reduce our energy consumption from operating technology applications. In conjunction with this work its also important that we educate and embed sustainable technology practices in how we deliver and maintain our applications. My interest is becoming sustainable and not wasting vital resources and as a result I have pursued a PhD research program focusing on the decarbonisation of the software project lifecycle. I really enjoy working with likeminded individuals working on solving problems to achieve positive outcomes."

bio: "Marjolein is an experienced software test consultant with a focus on functional and non-functional quality of software. 
In her opinion a product or system is not finished when it meets the specified functionality; she also emphasizes non-functional alspects as usability, user-friendliness, performance and sustainability. 
The last one she creates awareness about in her work and on the podia she speaks on. 
With simple examples she helps teams work on sustainable software in a sustainable way. 
She encourages people to work together in this and learn from each other. Together, step by step, we can make a huge difference!
She is a digital nomad and loves to take long walks in the mountains. She loves to read, cook and bake or ride her bike/kick-bike.

bio: "My background is with open source and digital accessibility. 
That said, there is a lot of overlap between building a quality site for inclusion and sustainability. 
I am a Drupal Core Accessibility Maintainer and also a contributor to the W3C's SustyWeb community. 
I contributed to both Tim Frick's book Designing for Sustainability and in the Sustainable Web Manifesto. 
I believe strongly in progress over perfection."

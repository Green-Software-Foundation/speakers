notes: Srini has been a regular speaker at Microsoft events on Artificial intelligence, Microservices and Sustainable architectures. Speaking at an event gives me an opportunity to do deep dive in the specific subject topic and enabling me to become a Subject matter expert. It also gives an opportunity for me to gain wider perspectives on the topic from the audience during the interactions and Q&A sessions. I am passionate about sustainability as a topic and way of life. Hence green software fits nicely into my background and I would like to share my knowledge through public speaking.
